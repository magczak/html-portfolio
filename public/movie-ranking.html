<h1>TV series Magda likes</h1>
<h2>3 best tv series I lately watched.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Handmaid's tale</h3>
<p>I really liked the use of colour palette in shots and visuals. Main characer decisions are kinda annoying after 2 first seasons, but overall pretty good series.</p>

<h3>The Good Place</h3>
<p>Amazing plot twists and story telling. I love to rewatch it, even though end of the series is a bit sugarcoated for me.</p>

<h3>1670</h3>
<p>Mocument about polish pesanats and nobility in barocco era. Amazing jokes and visuals.10/10!</p>
